# CRM
Prototype Client Relationship Management (CRM) System to manage a hypothetical physiotherapy service.
Developed using HTML/CSS/JavaScript along with node.js, mongoose, handlebars and MongoDB databases.
Database stores client and physiotherapists personal information along with physiotherapy session information.
User interface made using handlebars so user can interact with the database by adding, deleting, updating and searching for clients informatio (physiotherapist and session UI would be similiar to this).
REST API consists of routes, controllers and models for each database cluster.
